## Introduction
##### This paper by Baker et al. seeks to establish a relationship between neuronal projections from the Globus Pallidus external (GPe) to the Dorsal Striatum (dorsolateral specifically), and habitual drug seeking behavior. This analysis was conducted first by establishing which sub-region of the Dorsal Striatum is most dominantly innervated by projections from the GPe. Figure 1 examines the innervation of the Dorsal Striatum (lateral: DSL, medial: DSM) by GPe neurons. From this figure, I recreated Figure 1B and 1D. Figure 1B depicts the relative fluorescence of the DSL vs the DSM in response to an anterograde viral tracer injected into the GPe. Figure 1D depicts effectively the same information confirmed using the opposite direction of tracer (retrograde). THe higher the value of GPE Retrobead Cells/area (mm^2) directly correlates with the number of neurons that peoject between these regions.

### Figure 1 Results:
##### Both anterograde and retrograde tracer injections resulted in the conclusion that arkypallidal neurons from the GPe preferantially innervate the DLS over the DMS. 3 images were used to compute fluorescence values (or Retrobead #) for each analysis, and fluorescence of the GPe was used as the baseline value.
##### Data in Figure 1B was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with a TukeyHSD posthoc test. Data in Figure 1D were analyzed using a two-tailed t-test. 

##### Figure 2 demonstrates differences in behavioral phenotypes of mice trained on either a Random Ratio (RR) or Random Interval (RI) nose poke paradigm. In this behavioral training, mice are operantly conditioned to poke their nose into a hole with a sensor in order to gain a reward. Trials can be "Valued" or "Devalued". This means that for a correct response, the mouse will be rewarded (Valued) or not rewarded despite nose poking at the appropriate time (Devalued). For RR paradigms, if responses decrease during "Devalued" trials, this is indicative of goal-directed reward-seeking. For RI paradigms, if responses do not decrease during "Devalued" trials, this is indicative of habit-directed reward-seeking. For this figure, I chose to recreate panel B which compares the number of nose pokes between the "Valued" and "Devalued" trials in both the RR and RI behavioral paradigms. This data was compared against activity in GPe -> DLS and GPe -> DMS neurons to correlate neuronal activity with behavioral outcomes, but I did not recreate this aspect of the data for my assignment.

### Figure 2 Results:
##### Mice in the RI paradigm demonstrated a significant reduction in nose poke responses during the "Devalued" trial vs the "Valued" trial, indicating goal-directed reward-seeking behavior. Mice in the RR paradigm demonstrated no significant difference in nose poke responses during the "Devalued" vs "Valued" trials, indicating habit-directed reward-seeking. Data used for these analysis was # of nose pokes per mouse during a single test session (RI: n= 6, RR: n= 5).
##### Data in Figure 2B was analyzed using Wilcoxon Ranked Sum Test.

## Statistical Replication/Reanalysis
#### Replication of Fig 1B One-Way ANOVA:
##### I performed a One-Way ANOVA as described in the paper, though the direction of the alternative hypothesis was not defined by the authors. Thus, I chose the "greater" option, but the interpretation of the ANOVA remains the same. In my replication I was able to achieve the same values reported by the authors for both the ANOVA and the posthoc TukeyHSD.
```{r}
# One-Way ANOVA to see if brain region (DMS vs DLS) is predictive of relative fluorescence value.
aov1B <- aov(value ~ name, data= t, alternative= "two.sided")
summary(aov1B)
cat("\nPublication F-Value: 87.6\n", "Publication ANOVA p-value: p < 0.0001\n\n", "My F-Value: 87.6\n", "My p-value: 3.63e-05\n\n", sep= "")

# releveling dataframe 't' to have GPe as the reference level since the value in DMS and DLS are relative to the GPe values (which are all 1 anyway)
t <- within(t, name <- relevel(name, ref = "GPe"))

# Post-Hoc replication of the Tukey HSD performed in the study.
posthoc_aov1B <- TukeyHSD(aov1B, which= "name", conf.level= 0.95)
posthoc_aov1B

cat("Publication p-value: p < 0.0012\n", "My p-value: 0.0011652", sep= "")

# Printing out the R-squared value from the glance() function since this is not included in the summary of my anova object.
cat("R-squared: ", glance(aov1B)["r.squared"][[1]], sep= "")
```

#### Replication of Fig 1D Two-Sided t-Test:
##### I performed a two-sided t-test to compare the Retrobead Cells/Area (mm^2) between the DMS and DLS. Fortunately, I was able to replicate the results reported by the authors in this comparison. 
```{r}
# t-test to determine difference in Retrobead Cells/Area (mm^2) between the DLS and the DMS
ttest1D <- t.test(f1D$DMS_1D, f1D$DLS_1D, alternative= "two.sided")

cat("My p-value: 0.003099762\n")
glance(ttest1D)
cat("Publication p-value:", "p < 0.05")
```

#### Replication of Fig 2B Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test:
##### I performed two Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests to compare the nose pokes between the 'Valued' and 'Devalued' trials in both the RR and RI behavioral paradigms. Fortunately, I was able to replicate the outcome of the results reported by the authors in this comparison,  but my values were not exactly the same. Upon discussing this analysis further, it appears that this analysis is not appropriate for the RI behavioral paradigm data. This is because there are duplicate values in the 'Valued' and 'Devalued' columns, and "ties" are not properly addressed with this test.
```{r}
# Wilcoxon rank sum tests used to evaluate differences between nose pokes in 'Valued' and 'Devalued' trials in both the RR and RI behavioral paradigms.
f2B_wilcox1 <- wilcox.test(f2B$RR20_Valued, f2B$RR20_Devalued, alternative= "two.sided")
f2B_wilcox2 <- wilcox.test(f2B$RI120_Valued, f2B$RI120_Devalued, alternative= "two.sided")

# formatted output of the Wilcoxon test for both the RR and RI behavioral paradigms.
cat("Wilcox Test (RR)\nW:", 
    f2B_wilcox1["statistic"][[1]], 
    "\np-value:", f2B_wilcox1["p.value"][[1]],

## Summary/Discussion
#### Overall, I feel that I did a good job of replicating the figures and statistics given the information provided by the authors. There were a few notable difficulties with replicating this data, however I was generally satisfied with the reporting in this publication.

Initially, I began with recreating the figures that I thought would provide the most relevant information in a "summary version" of this paper. My R-ability was also considered in choosing the figures I wanted to replicate. Firstly, I appreciated that the Figure 1 graphics provided information that supported the hypothesis of the paper in a broader scope. I did have some issue when it came to Figure 1D. The figure legend incorrectly identifies what portion of the figure represents the Two-Sided t-Test (sub-fig C instead of the correct sub-fig: D). Despite this drawback, I was able to interpret what they intended to publish and my subsequent analysis did replicate the reported results.

Figure 2 was a more complicated figure replication, but the statistical analysis was very straight forward, and I was able to replicate the outcome of the authors results. Unfortunately, I was not able to replicate the exact values, but the interpretation fo my analysis is the same as the publication authors. Funny enough, this turned out to be a point of contention as the statistical test that was easy to replicate turned out to not to be the most appropriate for the underlying data. As mentioned in the Data Visualization Replication section, there were duplicate values in the comparison groups of my Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. One potential workaround would be to use a non-parametric analysis (such as permutation testing that we learned in class) to break the association between nose poke and trial value (i.e. whether the mouse was rewarded for a correct nose poke or not). Despite this information, I was able to recreate their analysis so I will consider this a success.

All of the figures that I chose to replicate displayed descriptive statistics of the data. For instance, each of the bar graphs that I plotted represent the mean value of the relevant data. I did not plot the error bars that can be seen on Figure 1B and 1D as I ran out of time and I couldn't figure out an eloquent programmatic way of adding this to the plot. My plan was to use the mean value of the relevant data, and then calculate standard error by using the sd() function to calculate standard deviations of the samples. Then I would devide the calculated sd() values by the square root of the sample size for each sub-figure. I intended to incorporate lines to represent confidence intervals using the annotate() fucntion that I used for many of the other lines on my figures.
